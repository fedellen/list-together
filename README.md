# **Typescript React Grocery List PWA**

Hello, I'm fedellen and this is my first typescript project -üî•üî•-üî•üî•->üëç

Typescript was the absolute hardest part of my programming learning journey. Whenever I encounter something frustrating and difficult, I always attempt do it first, and more often. Therefore, I decided to create a simple full stack application using as much Typescript as I could.

I can now safely say that Typescript is no longer difficult for me. In fact, I now prefer it over plain Javascript. After about a week of using Typescript regularly it became an extremely useful tool. There was a certain moment where I stopped struggling against the compiler and started withing **with** the compiler.

This is a simplistic list app built with fully functional offline capabilities and family sharing capabilities. I chose to create the backend on my own rather than using a service like Firebase mainly for the experience and portfolio building.

## **Backend**

- TypeORM
- Postgresql
- Type-GraphQL
- Express
- Apollo Server

Backend bootstrapped with:

```
typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres
```

## **Frontend**

- React
- Apollo Client
- GraphQL Codegen
- Workbox
- Tailwind

Frontend bootstrapped with

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa-typescript
```
