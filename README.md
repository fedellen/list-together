## **About**

Hello, I'm fedellen and this is my first typescript project -üî•üî•-üî•üî•->üëç

Typescript was the hardest part of my recent webdev learning journey. Whenever I encounter something frustrating and difficult, I've always attempted to meet that problem head on. Therefore, I decided to create a simple full stack application using as much Typescript as I possibly could.

I can now safely say that Typescript is no longer difficult for me. As expected, I now prefer it over plain Javascript as it provides much more information. After about a week of using Typescript regularly it became an extremely useful tool. There was a certain moment where I stopped struggling against the compiler and started working **with** the compiler.

After attempting several different offline-first with Apollo Client methods, I struggled to get offline mutations to work consistently enough to include this feature. Rather than starting over with a stack that includes more robust offline functionality, I decidied to finish this app with Apollo + GraphQL.
